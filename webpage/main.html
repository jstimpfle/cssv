<p>WSL is an extremely simple and practical plain text format for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">relational data</a>.  In
one sentence, WSL is basically notation for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> style database tuples
with a clean and canonical syntax supported by a schema language.</p>

<p>It was designed to be accessible to format-agnostic text utilities like grep
/ sed / awk and to be usable with version control systems like git, as well as
to spezialized editors / sanitizers / query processors that understand the
format and can take advantage of the schema information.</p>

<p>The tradeoff is that WSL files usually have to be scanned completely, and
therefore it's not suited for gigabytes of data. However most datasets are
small, so there are many excellent applications. Examples are accounting,
systems automation, data interchange, or web applications.</p>

<h2>Example database</h2>

<p>Here is an <a href="world_x.wsl.txt">an example WSL database</a>.

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/wsl/blob/master/wsl.txt">The current specification</a></p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/python-wsl/">python
library</a>. The <a href="http://jstimpfle.de/projects/python-wsl/doc/">API</a>
is in a stabilizing phase. (Linked API doc probably slightly outdated; check out
project sources).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/relational-calculus">proof-of-concept
implementation</a> of a query processor for a friendly logic query language,
supported from the command-line.</p>

<p>A fast <i>C library</i> is in the planning.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/python-wsl/blob/master/wslck">A basic
sanitizer and integrity checker</a> (needs the python library to run).</p>

<h2>Relational model</h2>

<p>The relational model was popularized by Edward Codd in the 1970's. To me its
essence is the insight that for persistent data <i>hierarchical
representations</i> are often a poor choice; <i>flat tables</i> are often
superior.</p>

<p>Why? Hierarchical structures can easily be emulated with flat database tuples
that reference each other. On the other hand, hierarchical representations are
just transformations of relational data that are opinionated about the access
path through which information should be extracted from the database. One has to
start at the top of a fixed hierarchy and navigate all the way to the bottom.
For example, a list of Employers each containing a list of his/her Employees.
But what if one wants to start from a given Employee and find all the Employee's
Employers? Too bad the hierarchies don't start with Employees, so one has to go
through all Employers and see if the Employee is there, writing a ton of ad-hoc
code (which breaks completely when the representation is changed).</p>

<p>Similarly it's difficult to define the structure of what goes where, and
which references resolve where, in a nested hierarchy. (The only widespread
hierarchical schema language I know of is XML DTD, but I'm not planning to get
more intimate with it...). If however we constrain to flat tables, it's easy to
express and implement these integrity constraints in a simple schema language
(like WSL's).</p>

<p>An important fact isn't known by many people who equate the relational model
with SQL: The relational model is closely connected to logic programming. It is
a restricted version of first order logic, where each table in the schema is a
predicate, and each database table is a universe where each predicate is true if
and only if the corresponding database tuple exists in the table.</p>

<p>For many logic queries, SQL is inconvenient. There are nicer more specialized
query syntaxes like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_relational_calculus">DRC</a>.</p>

<h2>WSL compared to JSON / S-Expressions / XML ...</h2>

<p>WSL is a notation for <i>relational data</i> (flat tables). It does not
directly serialize hierarchical data like JSON. However, much hierarchical data
found in practice would better be represented as relational data. (See
"Relational model").</p>

<p>JSON misses a standardized schema language, and as a consequence it misses a
nice lexical syntax (which would be easier with a schema) and support for data
integrity and hygiene. It also has only few basic available datatypes (no
support for extensions). So all in all JSON does not offer much support for data
modelling. Its success came mostly from mapping easily to the basic built-in
types of most dynamic languages.</p>

<p>The frequently called-for S-Exprs are in my book just a less popular and less
widely supported alternative to JSON. I'm not aware of significant technical
differences.</p>

<p>The situation is different with XML / DTD / XSLT, which do provide support
for well-formedness beyond syntax. But they are syntactically and conceptually
heavy; it's a pain to get them to do the simplest things.</p>

<h2>WSL compared to CSV</h2>

<p>The most well-known format for storing relations as text is CSV. It is
kind-of-portable, and, thanks to its simplicity, immensely popular and supported
in almost all programming and application environments. It has a number of
shortcomings, though. Compared to CSV, WSL offers</p>

<ul>
<li>Contains database (schema + many tables) instead of only one table
<li>Built-in datatypes with sane semantics (as opposed to only strings)
<li>Easy integration of custom datatypes offered by implementations
<li>Per-datatype lexical syntax for readable, editable, and hackable databases
<li>Unique and foreign keys supported
<li>Type information to support query languages
</ul>

<h2>WSL compared to SQL dump files</h2>

<p>The example database linked above was converted manually from <a
href="world_x.sql.txt">this sample database</a>, which is a (probably not very
portable) MySQL dump. (I haven't bothered to convert the JSON data in the
<tt>CountryInfo</tt> table). It is freely available from the <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html">MySQL website</a>. This is the
kind of data WSL was designed for.</p>

<p>The comparison to dump files might appear silly, but it illustrates WSL's
design goals.</p>

<table border="1" style="text-align: center">
<tr><td></td><th>SQL notation</th><th>WSL</th></tr>
<tr><th>standardized and portable format</th><td>schema features usually not portable across databases</td><td>Yes (but not widespread)</td></tr>
<tr><th>support for canonical data representation</th><td>weak (free-form syntax)</td><td>very strong (usually byte-precise serialization of tuples, ordering of tuples given by ordering of values)</td>
<tr><th>read- and edit-friendly</th><td>Barely</td><td>Yes (almost no punctuation, strict syntax rules)</td></tr>
<tr><th>scriptable / hackable</th><td>No</td><td>Yes (almost no punctuation, strict syntax rules)</td></tr>
<tr><th>supports data integrity</th><td>Yes</td><td>Usually sufficiently (unique and foreign keys, custom datatypes)</td></tr>
<tr><th>support for custom query languages</th><td>Rich type information</td><td>Rich and accessible type information</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The conversion was done with tedious regular expressions and manual selection
and editing. Conversely, it should be easy to re-create an SQL file from the WSL
database with vim or grep + sed. To be clean and hackable is one big point of
WSL.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Omitting column names and NULL</h3>

<p>An important design decision is to encourage many tables with few columns,
instead of few tables with many columns as is common with SQL and big datasets /
heavy database servers.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for this</p>

<ul>
<li>Practicality: At more than four or five columns, table rows become less practical to read and edit in a text editor.</li>
<li>Normalization: tables with fewer columns tend to carry more relational
meaning. In SQL culture, tables with more columns typically have many NULL-able
attribute/tag/comment type columns and are quite denormalized (and so are in
particular OUTER JOINS of such tables).</li>
</ul>

<p>One way in which WSL encourages fewer columns is leaving out column names.
This forces the schema designer to communicate meaning of data with the names of
<i>relations</i> (i.e. tables) and the relations' <i>domains</i> (i.e. column
types) instead, which is desirable. This is supported by the separation of the
concepts of datatypes (which can't be used directly as columns) and domains
(which have to be declared as "instances" of datatypes with optional
parameterization).</p>

<p>Take as an example the definition of the <tt>City</tt> table.</p>

<pre>
% DOMAIN CityID Integer
% DOMAIN CityName String
% DOMAIN District String
% DOMAIN Population Integer
% TABLE City CityID CityName CountryCode District Population
</pre>

<p>Here we first create new meaningful domains from available datatypes. Now the
meanings of a table's columns are clear from their domains and from the table
name. Having many distinct domains is also really useful to avoid comparing
apples with oranges in logic queries.</p>

<p>Only rarely is this approach problematic, when a table has two columns of the
same datatype and it's not super clear which column has what meaning in the
relation. On the other hand, anybody who has written their share of SQL joins
will know how painful it is to have to rename columns for each intermediate
table because either the names clash or the context changed so the name is not
appropriate anymore.</p>

<p>Another means to keep the number of columns low is omitting NULL-able
columns. The practical effects of this are illustrated by the conversion of the
example SQL database to WSL. The <tt>Country</tt> table had to be split in two.
The SQL version</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE `Country` (
  `Code` char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `Name` char(52) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `Capital` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Code2` char(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
</pre>

<p>was translated to</p>

<pre>
% TABLE Country CountryCode CountryCode2 CountryName
% TABLE Capital CountryCode CityID
</pre>

<p>(integrity constraints omitted). In this way the number of columns per table
was reduced, normalization was improved, and the need for a NULL-able column
went away.</p>
