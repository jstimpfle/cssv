<p>WSL is a clean and practical plain text format for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">relational data</a>. It
consists of a schema language and a notation for typed database tuples with
schema-supported lexical syntax.</p>

<p>It is accessible to format-agnostic text utilities like grep / sed / awk , as
well as to spezialized tools that understand the format and can take advantage
of the schema information. Thanks to its simplicity it is also very amenable for
tooling &mdash; for example logical or hierarchial query languages.</p>

<h2>Example database</h2>

<p>Here is an <a href="world_x.wsl.txt">an example WSL database</a>.

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/wsl/blob/master/wsl.txt">The current specification</a></p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/python-wsl/">python library</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/jstimpfle/relational-calculus">proof-of-concept
implementation</a> of a query processor for a friendly logic query language,
supported from the command-line.</p>

<p>A fast <i>C library</i> is in the planning.</p>

<h2>Practical advantages</h2>

<ul>
<li>Textual storage: version control, editing with the editor of your
choice, reliable and convenient data exchange, good scriptability.</li>
<li>Domain-specific and user-defined lexers: minimal syntactic overhead (better
readability, scriptability, canonic representation</li>
<li>Schema support: check data integrity, build tooling and query
languages.</li>
<li>Use the python3 implementation (more to come) to parse or format runtime
objects from/to text files or streams, in a single line of code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relational model</h2>

<p>The relational model was popularized by Edward Codd in the 1970's. The
message was: For persistent data <i>hierarchical representations</i> are often a
poor choice; <i>flat tables</i> are often superior.</p>

<p>Why? Hierarchical structures can easily be emulated with flat database tuples
that reference each other. On the other hand, hierarchical representations are
just transformations of relational data that are opinionated about the access
path through which information should be extracted from the database. One has to
start at the top of a fixed hierarchy and navigate all the way to the bottom.
For example, a list of Employers each containing a list of his/her Employees.
But what if one wants to start from a given Employee and find all the Employee's
Employers? Too bad the hierarchies don't start with Employees, so one has to go
through all Employers and see if the Employee is there, writing a ton of ad-hoc
code (which breaks easily when the representation is changed).</p>

<p>Similarly it's difficult to define the structure of what goes where, and
which references resolve where, in a nested hierarchy. (Maybe the only somewhat
popular hierarchical schema language is XML DTD, but it is not easy to use). If
however we constrain data modelling to flat tables, it's easy to express and
implement integrity constraints in a simple schema language.</p>

<p>The relational model is closely connected to logic programming. It is a
restricted version of first order logic, where each table in the schema is a
predicate, and each database table is a universe where each predicate is true if
and only if the corresponding database tuple exists in the table.</p>

<h2>WSL compared to JSON / S-Expressions / XML ...</h2>

<p>WSL is a notation for <i>relational data</i> (flat tables). It does not
directly serialize hierarchical data like JSON. However, much hierarchical data
found in practice would better be represented as relational data. (See
"Relational model").</p>

<p>JSON lacks a standardized schema language, and as a consequence it can't
provide a lexical syntax that is both convenient and canonical ("pick one") and
can't support data integrity. It also has only few basic available datatypes. So
all in all JSON does not offer much support for data modelling. Its success came
mostly from mapping easily to the basic built-in types of most dynamic
languages.</p>

<p>S-Expressions are somewhat similar to JSON. But they are even less widely
supported and I'm not aware of standardized integrity schemes.</p>

<p>The situation is different with XML / DTD / XSLT, which do provide support
for well-formedness beyond syntax. But they are syntactically and conceptually
heavy.</p>

<h2>WSL compared to CSV</h2>

<p>CSV is the most widespread format for storing relations as text. It is
kind-of-portable, and, thanks to its simplicity, immensely popular and supported
virtually everywhere. It has a number of shortcomings, though. Compared to CSV,
WSL offers</p>

<ul>
<li>Contains database (schema + many tables) instead of only one table
<li>Primitive types; built-in and extendable types (CSV has only strings)
<li>Per-type lexical syntax: more readable, editable, scriptable
<li>Better Integrity: primitive types, unique and foreign keys
</ul>

<h2>WSL compared to SQL dump files</h2>

<p>The <a href="world_x.wsl.txt">example database</a> was converted manually
from <a href="world_x.sql.txt">this sample database</a>, which is a (probably
not very portable) MySQL dump. (I haven't bothered to convert the JSON data in
the <tt>CountryInfo</tt> table). It is freely available from the <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html">MySQL website</a>. This is the
kind of data WSL was designed for.</p>

<p>A comparison to dump files might appear silly, but it illustrates WSL's
design goals. The conversion was done with tedious regular expressions and
manual selection and editing. Conversely, it should be easy to re-create an SQL
file from the WSL database with vim or grep + sed.</p>

<h2>Design decisions</h2>

<p>One design decision was to encourage many tables with few columns, instead of
few tables with many columns as is common with SQL and big datasets / heavy
database servers.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for this</p>

<ul>
<li>Practicality: At more than four or five columns, table rows become less practical to read and edit in a text editor.</li>
<li>Normalization: tables with fewer columns tend to carry more relational
meaning. In SQL culture, tables with more columns typically have many NULL-able
attribute/tag/comment type columns and are quite denormalized (and so are in
particular OUTER JOINS of such tables).</li>
</ul>

<p>One way in which WSL encourages fewer columns is making column names
optional. The schema designer is encouraged to communicate meaning of data only
through table names and their columns' types. This is supported by the
separation of the concepts of datatypes (which can't be used directly as
columns) and domains (which have to be declared as "instances" of datatypes with
optional parameterization).</p>

<p>Take as an example the definition of the <tt>City</tt> table.</p>

<pre>
% DOMAIN CityID Integer
% DOMAIN CityName String
% DOMAIN District String
% DOMAIN Population Integer
% TABLE City CityID CityName CountryCode District Population
</pre>

<p>Here we first create new meaningful domains from available datatypes. Now the
meanings of a table's columns are clear from their domains and from the table
name. Having many distinct domains is also really useful to avoid comparing
apples with oranges in logic queries.</p>

<p>Only rarely is this approach problematic, when a table has two columns of the
same datatype and it's not super clear which column has what meaning in the
relation. On the other hand, anybody who has written their share of SQL joins
will know how painful it is to have to rename columns for each intermediate
table because either the names clash or the context changed so the name is not
appropriate anymore.</p>

<p>Another means to keep the number of columns low is omitting (first class)
NULL-able columns. The practical effects of this are illustrated by the
conversion of the example SQL database to WSL. The <tt>Country</tt> table had to
be split in two. The SQL version</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE `Country` (
  `Code` char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `Name` char(52) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `Capital` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Code2` char(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
</pre>

<p>was translated to</p>

<pre>
% TABLE Country CountryCode CountryCode2 CountryName
% TABLE Capital CountryCode CityID
</pre>

<p>(integrity constraints omitted). In this way the number of columns per table
was reduced, normalization was improved, and the need for a NULL-able column
went away.</p>
